# Geoloc

## Experiments location

The code to perform experiments like the ones presented on the thesis are located on the following folders:

```
exps/iden:   Identification of interesting problems on the P and C spectre.
exps/psize:  Analysis of the effect of the PZ on the optimality.
exps/vrfx:   Analysis of the effect of the VR on the optimality.
exps/disim:  Detailed analysis of the behavior of VR.
exps/allgen: Testing several algorithms.
```

The problems usually have a `vars` file with the experiment variables, a `generate` script that creates the problems, a `solve` script that solves the problems and summarizes the results and a `collect` script that takes the summaries and transform them into graphs.

## C code and Python tools

The main version of the algorithm is done in the C language. To compile and create `geoloc.exe`:

```bash
$ make geoloc
```

To create a random test problem with `100` clients and `50` facility locations on a rectangle of size `1000`, with a facility fixed cost of `800`, a variant gain of `300`, and transport cost per weight unit of `1`:

```bash
$ mkdir -p cases
$ python3 tools/prob_generator.py 100 50 1000 800 300 1 cases/test_prob.txt
```

This will create the file `cases/test_prob.txt` with a generic definition of the problem.

To create a definition of the problem that can be used as input for `geoloc`, you use the translator:

```bash
$ python3 tools/prob_translator.py cases/test_prob.txt geoloc cases/test_geoloc_prob.txt
```

To run the program over the test case, with a pool size of `100` and a vision range of `20`, saving the `10` best solutions to the `cases/test_res.txt` file:

```bash
$ ./geoloc.exe 100 20 10 cases/test_geoloc_prob.txt cases/test_res.txt
```

To create an `svg` image of the best solution:

```bash
$ python3 tools/svg_generator.py -g cases/test_res.txt cases/test_prob.txt cases/test_res.svg
```

`cases/test_res.svg` is the resulting image.

To create a linear programming problem for `lp_solve` from the test case:

```bash
$ python3 tools/prob_translator.py cases/test_prob.txt lpsolve cases/test_lp_prob.lp
```

```

## Haskell code

The haskell code, on `hs_src` is a previous version of the algorithm, not as fast than the C one but highly more generalized. The generalized functions are placed on `Exploration.hs`, the particular case of facility location on two dimentional euclidian space is defined on `Geoloc.hs`.

* Install packages with `cabal` (package `cabal-install` in `dnf`):

```bash
$ cabal update
$ cabal install <package>
```

* Package `munkres` for the hungarian method, thanks to *Balazs Komuves*.

## Dependencies:

For the `loglogloglinreg.py` tool, the `python3-scikit-learn` package is required.
